    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This homemade mac and cheese recipe uses a classic mixture of sharp Cheddar and Parmesan. 
            Cheddar is a fantastic base, while Parmesan adds a more complex and salty flavor. 
            Of course, you can adapt this recipe to suit your taste: Gruyere, Monterey Jack, and Gouda are all great options for macaroni and cheese.
